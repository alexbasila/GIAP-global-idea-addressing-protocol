# GIAP – Global Idea Addressing Protocol

**The moment you have an idea, GIAP asks if you want to give it an address on the net – and see matching ideas.**  
The net connects people; **GIAP connects only ideas**.

## What is GIAP?
GIAP (Global Idea Addressing Protocol) is a neutral, global protocol layer that:
- Assigns a unique, permanent address to each idea at the moment of its creation.
- Instantly connects it to matching ideas worldwide – independent of person, status, or location.
- Gives control of visibility and access rights to the originator.


## Example
A student in Nairobi imagines a new water filter.  
Without GIAP: years of chance connections.  
With GIAP: seconds to engineers in Seattle, patent counsel in Zurich, and sponsors in Singapore.


## Why "Churchen"?
**Churchen** is the act of giving an idea its address and making it visible in the idea network.  
GIAP is the technology – Churchen is the moment of connection.

## Feedback
This is a **resonance test**.  
- Would you use such a system?  
- What would stop you from connecting your ideas this way?
